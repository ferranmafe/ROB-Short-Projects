## Description

### Short Project 1 (P1)
Simulation of the movement of a 6R arm made using MATLAB. The idea behind this project is the understanding of
the usage of coordinates transforms to define coordinates in each of the frames defined using the world frame as base (0, 0, 0) and
the usage of inverse kinematics.

Al the code related to the short project (the one made by the students) is stored in the folder _ShortProject1_Ferran_Martinez_Daniel_Martinez.m_.
