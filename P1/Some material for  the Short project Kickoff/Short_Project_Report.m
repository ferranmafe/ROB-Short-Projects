%% Short Project.
% After atending the Laboratory session and Theory classes you must be
% able to answer the following questions.
% Add the necessary matlab and RTB sentences to this script for reporting
% your result. I strongly recoment to use as a reference help for the RTB the file 'robot.pdf'
% http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox
%% Sketching the enviroment of the robotics work cell.
% It is spected: main reference frames. Plot the robot Puma, draw the
% working table and the torus in working position.
% Give diferent points of view of the scenary: Top, Front, Lateral and
% isometrics view.
%% Working points.
% Give here your code to get the variables to locate:
% a) The reference frame for all drills holes, such that z-axis is orthogonal
% to the surface of the torus and the x-axis is in the direction of minimun
% curvature. Draw in scale the frames
% b) Repeat the obove operation for the center of the milling groove. Draw
% this frames.
% c) The reference frames for all welding points, such that z-axis of the tool 
% is orthogonal to the surface of the torus and the x-axis is in the direction of 
% spiral trajectory. Draw in scale the frames
%% Computing motor torques for the static forces.
% Give here your code to fill two tables with the motor torque at each robot pose:
% Table 1 (6x16): Rows are the motor torques (6x1). Columns (1x16) are the labeled drills
% including the initial drill before milling.
% Table 2 (6x8): Rows are the motor torques (6x1). Columns (1x8) are the
% labeled milling of the groove.
